# homePageForwarding
The browsers are always having the embbed language 2-letter code for each language switching. So, I'd like to design an auto-forwarding pattern for the index page of the website.

# Approach
1. To gain the list of the 2-letter code from the offical ISO document.
2. Format the list to JSON.
3. Design the match pattern.
